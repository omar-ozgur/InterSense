# InterSense
An application that allows users to find safe map routes based on air quality data.

## Information

This application was developed during the IDEA Hacks 2016 hackathon at UCLA. My team used an Arduino MQ2 gas sensor to detect air pollutants such as LPG, methane, i-butane, smoke, and alcohol. We mapped this data using the Google Maps API, and used the same API to find routes based on an origin and destination. Our simple algorithm calculates the average pollution amount for a given route, and colors the routes accordingly (green=safe, red=harmful).

## Notes

Although my team only spent a few days developing this product, we believe that it would be benefitial to allow others to use this data for the benefit of everyone. Feel free to download this project and expand on features as you see fit.
